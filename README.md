# Create App

Starter Kit for Builders

## Getting Started 

To run locally, first install.

Then, run the command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will serve the widgets from `http://127.0.0.1:4040/api/loader`. (or 8080)

Go to [everything.dev/flags](https://everything.dev) and paste this value there.

Once set, see the locally served app at [create.near/widget/app](https://everything.dev/create.near/widget/app).
